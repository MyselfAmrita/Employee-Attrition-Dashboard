# Employee-Attrition-Dashboard
 Created an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize employee attrition data.
 Used DAX measures to calculate additional insights, such as the average attrition rate for each department and the number of months it takes for an employee to leave the company after being hired. 
 The dashboard is a valuable tool for HR professionals who want to track employee attrition and identify trends.
